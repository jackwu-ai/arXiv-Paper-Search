# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Basic Frontend Templates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the HTML templates for the search interface and results display.
# Details:
Create two main templates in the templates directory:

1. base.html (layout template):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{% block title %}arXiv Explorer{% endblock %}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1><a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">arXiv Explorer</a></h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>Powered by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/api/" target="_blank">arXiv API</a></p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

2. index.html (search and results):
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<section class="search-section">
    <form method="GET" action="{{ url_for('search') }}" class="search-form">
        <input type="text" name="query" placeholder="Search arXiv papers..." value="{{ query if query }}" required>
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
</section>

{% if results %}
<section class="results-section">
    <h2>Search Results{% if query %} for "{{ query }}"{% endif %}</h2>
    
    {% if results.error %}
    <div class="error-message">
        <p>{{ results.error }}</p>
    </div>
    {% elif results.papers|length == 0 %}
    <div class="no-results">
        <p>No papers found matching your search criteria.</p>
    </div>
    {% else %}
    <div class="results-count">
        <p>Found {{ results.total_results }} results (showing {{ results.papers|length }})</p>
    </div>
    
    <ul class="papers-list">
        {% for paper in results.papers %}
        <li class="paper-item">
            <h3 class="paper-title">{{ paper.title }}</h3>
            <div class="paper-meta">
                <span class="paper-authors">{{ paper.authors|join(', ') }}</span>
                <span class="paper-date">{{ paper.published[:10] }}</span>
            </div>
            <p class="paper-summary">{{ paper.summary[:300] }}{% if paper.summary|length > 300 %}...{% endif %}</p>
            <div class="paper-links">
                <a href="{{ paper.pdf_link }}" target="_blank" class="pdf-link">PDF</a>
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/{{ paper.id }}" target="_blank" class="arxiv-link">arXiv</a>
            </div>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
</section>
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

# Test Strategy:
Manually verify that the templates render correctly with sample data. Check that all required elements are present and properly structured. Test the responsiveness of the design by viewing it at different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Layout Template [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the base layout template that will contain common elements like header, footer, navigation, and CSS/JS imports to be inherited by other templates.
### Details:
Implementation Guidelines:
- Create a base.html template with Jinja2 syntax

- Text remains readable at all viewport sizes
- Page load time is optimized with proper resource loading

Progress Update:
Verified that `app/templates/base.html` includes the correct responsive viewport meta tag and links to Bootstrap CSS, providing a responsive foundation. The main content in `app/templates/index.html` uses Bootstrap's `container` class and standard HTML elements that will adapt to different screen sizes. The HTML structure is now prepared to support responsive design. Detailed implementation of responsive CSS media queries, fine-tuning for touch interfaces, specific browser compatibility adjustments, and readability optimizations across all devices will be addressed in Task 4 (Implement CSS Styling) and during dedicated testing phases. No specific code changes were made to `index.html` for this subtask as its current structure is already conducive to basic responsiveness provided by Bootstrap.
