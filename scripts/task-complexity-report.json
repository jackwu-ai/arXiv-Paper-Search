      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the directory structure and files, 2) Initializing git repository and setting up .gitignore, and 3) Creating the basic Flask application skeleton with requirements.txt. For each subtask, provide detailed steps and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves basic project setup with predefined structure. While straightforward for experienced developers, it requires careful organization of directories, files, and dependencies. Breaking it into 3 subtasks would help track progress on directory creation, git initialization, and Flask app setup separately."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement arXiv API Wrapper' task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the API request functionality, 2) Implementing XML response parsing, 3) Creating data models/structures for parsed papers, and 4) Writing comprehensive unit tests. For each subtask, include detailed implementation guidelines and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration, XML parsing, and error handling. The complexity comes from working with the arXiv API's specific format, handling various edge cases in XML parsing, and ensuring robust error handling. Four subtasks would allow focused work on API requests, response parsing, data modeling, and testing."

For each subtask, provide detailed implementation guidelines and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating HTML templates with Jinja2 syntax for a Flask application. While the templates are provided in the details, implementing them correctly with proper inheritance and ensuring they work with the backend requires attention to detail. Three subtasks would separate the layout concerns from functional components."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement CSS Styling' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing base styles and layout CSS, 2) Creating styles for the search form and results display, and 3) Adding responsive design rules for different screen sizes. For each subtask, include specific styling guidelines and visual acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive CSS stylesheet with responsive design considerations. While the CSS is provided, implementing it correctly and ensuring it works across different browsers and screen sizes requires attention to detail. Three subtasks would allow focused work on different aspects of the styling."

For each subtask, provide detailed implementation steps and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating Flask routes that connect the frontend templates with the arXiv API wrapper. It requires understanding of Flask's application context, request handling, and template rendering. The complexity comes from integrating multiple components and handling various edge cases in search queries."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement Error Handling' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing custom exception classes, 2) Adding error handling for API requests and network issues, 3) Handling XML parsing errors and invalid inputs, and 4) Creating user-friendly error messages and logging. For each subtask, include detailed implementation guidelines and testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive error handling across the application. It requires anticipating various failure modes, implementing proper exception handling, and providing meaningful feedback to users. The complexity comes from handling different types of errors (network, parsing, user input) and ensuring the application remains stable under all conditions."

For each subtask, provide detailed implementation guidelines and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating utility functions for formatting different types of data and integrating them with the templates. It requires attention to detail for date formatting, author list truncation, and summary text handling. Three subtasks would allow focused work on different aspects of the formatting logic."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Add Basic JavaScript Enhancements' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing form validation and submission handling, 2) Creating loading indicators and search state management, and 3) Adding interactive features for paper summaries. For each subtask, include detailed implementation guidelines and testing scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves adding client-side JavaScript to enhance the user experience. While the functionality is relatively simple, it requires careful integration with the existing HTML/CSS and consideration of different browsers. Three subtasks would separate the form handling logic from the UI state management and interactive features."
