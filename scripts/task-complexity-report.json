      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation and deployment task into the following subtasks: (1) Write a comprehensive README with setup, usage, and troubleshooting; (2) Develop platform-specific deployment guides (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Docker); (3) Document API usage and code structure, including endpoint details and code map; (4) Prepare deployment scripts and CI/CD automation; (5) Conduct peer review and validation of all documentation by having another developer follow the instructions from scratch.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple documentation types (user, developer, deployment), script creation, and validation, requiring coordination and attention to detail. While not algorithmically complex, it spans several domains and must be clear, accurate, and accessible, which increases its overall complexity. The presence of dependencies and the need for cross-platform instructions further justify a moderate complexity score and the need for at least five subtasks to ensure thorough coverage."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this feature into the following subtasks: (1) Design and implement the UI element for triggering summarization and displaying results; (2) Integrate logic to collect abstracts from search results and handle edge cases (e.g., fewer than five results, missing abstracts); (3) Develop the backend integration with the LLM API, including prompt construction and error handling; (4) Implement loading indicators and user feedback for the summarization process; (5) Ensure accessibility and cross-browser/device compatibility of the UI; (6) Write and execute comprehensive tests for all edge cases and error scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires frontend and backend changes, integration with an external AI API, robust error handling, and attention to accessibility and UX. The need to manage asynchronous operations, handle API failures, and ensure privacy/security adds to the complexity. The feature also introduces new UI/UX flows and must be thoroughly tested, justifying a higher complexity score and at least six subtasks for proper implementation and validation."
